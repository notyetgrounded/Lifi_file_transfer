llllllllllllllIn this project, we are using UART protocol 
With bit length 8 
With a baud rate of 2500 
And a bit time of 400 microseconds 
A led is connected to the transmitter esp32 to transmit light pulses
An analog ambient light sensor and SD card is connected to the receiver esp32 to read light intensity and save the received data
